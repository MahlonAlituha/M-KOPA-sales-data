#### Data cleaning 

The data cleaning involved getting rid of raws with null values as well as outliers found in the price and sales columns, a particular raw stated a product to cost 1 KES and a single unit sold over the past year. Not such a common scenario based on intuition that no electric device could cost 1 Kenya Shilling.

#### Data Analysis

Sales were analysed by the groupby function to understand which payment plan had the highest sales for each particular month.

|:----------|:--------------------|--------:|
| January   | MK 6000 32" TV v22  |    1163 |
| February  | MK 6000 32" TV v22  |     630 |
| March     | MK 600 24" TV v20   |     599 |
| April     | MK 600 24" TV v20   |     615 |
| May       | MK 600 24" TV v20   |     124 |
| June      | MK 6000 32" TV v20  |    1234 |
| July      | MK 6000 32" TV v21  |    1279 |
| August    | MK 6000 32" TV v21  |    2109 |
| September | MK 6000 32" TV v22  |    1097 |
| October   | MK 600 24" TV v18   |     649 |
| November  | MK 600 24" TV v18   |     628 |
| December  | MK 600 24" TV v20   |    1608 |

A revenue column was added to the dataframe and it was got as a multiplication of the unit and price of each product sold. It is noted that M-KOPA 6000 made the highest revenue whilst M-KOPA +500 made the least revenue the past financial year. All other revenue generating subcategories are as seen below;
